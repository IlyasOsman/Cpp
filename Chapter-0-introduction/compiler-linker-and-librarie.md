## Introduction to the compiler, linker, and libraries

- A compiler is a program that translates C++ source code into machine code.
- The linker is a program that combines object files (created by the compiler) into an executable program.
- Libraries are collections of pre-compiled code that can be linked into C++ programs.

   ``` Source-file(.cpp) ==> Object-file(.o) aka machine language file ==> Linking object file and library ==> Executable file(.exe/ depending on OS)```

- A library file is a collection of precompiled code that has been “packaged up” for reuse in other programs.
